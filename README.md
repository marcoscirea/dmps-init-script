# dmps-init-script
Init script for starting DMPServer for Kerbal Space Program

# Usage
To use, puit in your /etc/init.d folder (or equivalent), then create a file /etc/default/ksp as specified in the ksp script.

Once set up, you can make it start automatcally on boot by using the command "update-rc.d ksp defaults".

I made this for my server on the Raspberry Pi, hopefully it should be useful for somebody else :)
